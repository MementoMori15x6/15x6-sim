# Contributing to The Board – Political Thermodynamics

Thank you for considering a contribution. This project is intentionally open and minimalist: a microscope, not a cathedral.

## Ways to Contribute

1. **Re-score a system**  
   Fork → edit data/35_metrics_placeholders.csv (or add your_own_system.csv) → run iterative_dynamics.ipynb → submit a PR with your CSV, resulting plots, and any new longevity/bifurcation insights.

2. **Improve the pipeline**  
   - Better soft-projection tuning (γ, ε)  
   - Commensalism extensions or Z-axis prototypes  
   - Nonlinear damping variants  
   - Monte Carlo sensitivity sweeps  

3. **Add case studies**  
   New historical/modern/biological examples (corporations, religions, pathogens, startups) with CSV + narrative.

4. **Documentation & tests**  
   Expand Appendix A proofs, add unit tests for bifurcation functions, improve notebook visualizations.

## Guidelines
- Keep changes reproducible (public data sources, fixed seeds).  
- No narrative overrides—let the grid speak.  
- PRs welcome; issues for discussion first.

The Board is a shared diagnostic tool. Bring your evidence, run the simulation, and let's see what patterns emerge.

Memento mori. 🚀
