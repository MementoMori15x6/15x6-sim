"Metric","Description","Score","Rationale"
"A1","Property rights",-9,"Private property is heavily restricted; land and major industries are state-owned under the Juche socialist system."
"A2","Market allocation",-8,"Central planning dominates allocation; black markets exist but are suppressed, and official allocation is state-directed."
"A3","Profit motive",-9,"Profit-seeking is criminalized outside state channels; individual accumulation is equated with counter-revolutionary behavior."
"B1","Redistribution",-7,"The Public Distribution System centrally allocates food and goods by political loyalty tier (songbun); elites receive disproportionate share."
"B2","Welfare",-6,"Nominal universal services (healthcare, housing, education) are provided, but quality and access vary widely and are tied to loyalty."
"C1","Heredity fidelity",-9,"Leadership has passed through the Kim family across three generations with near-total hereditary fidelity; songbun status is inherited."
"C2","Variation allowance",-9,"Political and ideological variation is forbidden; deviation from Juche is punished as treason."
"C3","Persistence differential",-8,"Loyalist families and military elites persist through generations; disloyalty leads to purge or labor camps."
"D1","Parasitism tolerance",-4,"The regime itself functions as an extractive parasitic layer on the population; internal parasitism by non-elite actors is suppressed, but systemic top-down extraction is normalized."
"D2","Competition intensity",-9,"Political and economic competition is structurally eliminated; all organs are subordinated to Kim authority."
"E1","Survival until replication",-4,"Regime has survived sanctions and isolation through repression and Chinese patronage, but population survival rates during the 1990s famine were catastrophically poor."
"E2","Niche construction",-6,"Nuclear deterrence and strategic brinkmanship create a security niche at the cost of economic and demographic vitality."
"F1","Boundary maintenance",-10,"Borders are among the world's hardest; defection is punishable by execution or gulag."
"F2","Error repair",-8,"Policy failures (famine, stagnation) are denied or blamed externally; internal correction is rare and punitive."
"G1","Cheater detection",-5,"Massive surveillance and mutual monitoring enforce loyalty; cheater detection serves regime control rather than system health."
"G2","Modularity",-7,"Power is centralized; institutional modularity is suppressed in favor of monolithic party-state-military unity."
"G3","Info storage",-7,"State-controlled archives and propaganda preserve regime narrative; independent knowledge is restricted."
"H1","Cultural uniformity",-10,"Juche ideology enforces near-total cultural homogeneity through education and propaganda."
"H2","Ideological monopoly",-10,"Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism is the sole permitted ideological framework."
"H3","Dissent suppression",-10,"Political dissent is met with extreme suppression via labor camps and collective punishment."
"I1","Family autonomy",-9,"Families are subject to collective punishment for political crimes of members."
"I2","Religious freedom",-10,"Independent religious practice is prohibited; state-controlled churches are performative."
"I3","Artistic expression",-10,"Art serves state ideology; unauthorized production is criminal."
"J1","Scientific direction",-7,"Science is directed toward regime-priority projects (nuclear, missiles); basic research is suppressed."
"J2","Education indoctrination",-10,"Education centers on ideological indoctrination and loyalty to the Kim dynasty."
"J3","Media control",-10,"All media is state-owned; foreign media possession is criminalized."
"K1","Military priority",-10,"Songun (military-first) policy prioritizes armed forces in resource allocation."
"K2","Isolationism",-9,"Regime maintains near-total diplomatic and economic isolation by design."
"K3","External threat narrative",-10,"Constant emphasis on U.S. and South Korean hostility legitimizes internal repression."
"L1","Succession mechanism",-9,"Succession operates through opaque hereditary designation with no institutional mechanism."
"L2","Leadership cult",-10,"Kim family cult of personality is among the most extreme in history."
"L3","Purge cycles",-9,"Frequent purges of elites to maintain control."
"M1","Natalism",-6,"State rhetorically encourages population growth for military needs; resource shortages limit effectiveness."
"M2","Migration control",-10,"Emigration is prohibited; internal movement is tightly regulated."
"M3","Ethnic policy",-7,"Regime promotes ethnic homogeneity and restricts foreign integration."
