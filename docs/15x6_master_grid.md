### 1.4 Deriving the Fifteen Base Rules from First Principles

Each rule derived step-by-step with minimal assumptions. See the blank Master Grid and quick rules list on page 99 (toggle for details) for interactive reference.
| # | Rule | Physical / game-theoretic necessity | One-sentence proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Harvest negative entropy | 2nd Law of Thermodynamics | If you don’t, you disassemble |
| 2 | Replicate with heredity | Definition of a replicator | If the pattern is not copied faithfully, replication ceases (proposed as definitional). |
| 3 | Allow heritable variation | Source of selectable diversity | Perfect copying → no evolution → extinction when environment shifts |
| 4 | Differential persistence | Finite world | Some variants must out-replicate others or nothing happens |
| 5 | Individual survival until replication | Carrier must last long enough | Dead carriers don’t copy |
| 6 | Resource acquisition & defense | Resources are finite | You lose if competitors take them first |
| 7 | Reproductive success (direct or inclusive) | Ultimate currency of the game | Patterns that don’t get copied disappear |
| 8 | Adaptation to change | Environments are non-stationary | Static strategies lose |
| 9 | Diversity maintenance | Life hedges existential risk | Monoculture = single-point failure |
| 10 | Niche construction & colonization | Empty energy gradients are free real estate | If you don’t take them, someone else will |
| 11 | Boundary maintenance | Concentration gradients are required for work | No membrane/identity → dissipation |
| 12 | Error detection & repair | Mutation & entropy are constant | Unrepaired errors → error catastrophe |
| 13 | Cheater detection & suppression | Cooperation is exploitable | Without immune system, mutualism collapses to parasitism |
| 14 | Hierarchical / modular organization | Complexity requires stable sub-units | Flat systems cannot scale |
| 15 | Information storage separated from execution | Pattern must outlive the machinery that expresses it | Somatic suicide is the norm; germline (or constitution) survives |

The Six Moves 
- **++ (Mutualism)**: Stable if both benefit (e.g., via reciprocal exchange). Possible under Rule 6 (shared resource defense).
- **+0 (Commensalism)**: Stable if A gains without costing B (e.g., spillover benefits). Rule 11 (boundaries) allows this without leakage.
- **+– (Parasitism/Predation)**: Stable if A exploits B asymmetrically. Rule 13 evolves countermeasures, but the dyad persists until host collapse.
- **–– (Competition)**: Stable zero-sum rivalry (e.g., scramble for Rule 6 resources). Drives Rule 8 adaptation.
- **0– (Amensalism)**: Stable if B suffers without A gaining (e.g., byproduct harm). Rare but stable under Rule 12 (unrepaired errors).
- **00 (Neutralism)**: Stable indifference (e.g., non-overlapping niches, Rule 9).
